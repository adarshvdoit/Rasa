  utter_WhatisESR:
  - text: "* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a study performed to determine presence of inflammation in the body \n* If there is inflammation present, the red blood cells sink faster than normal because inflammation causes RBCs to clump together and therefore be heavier \n* Normal range for men is 0 – 22 mm/hr and for women is 0 – 29 mm/hr"

  utter_Whatisanemiaofchronicdisease:
  - text: "*Anemia of chronic disease occurs in patients who have a chronic, inflammatory condition (includes chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancy) resulting in release of liver factors such as hepcidin, which traps iron inside cells such as macrophages \n\t*As a result, this iron cannot be utilized by RBCs to help with the transport of oxygen"

  utter_Whatexactlydovitalsignsinclude:
  - text: "*Heart rate (normal between 60 – 100 beat per minute)\n*Respiratory rate (normal between 12 – 24 breaths/minute)\n*Temperature (normal between 97.8F – 99.1F)\n*Blood pressure (normal level is less than 120/80 mm Hg)"

  utter_WhatdoesMCVmean:
  - text: "*MCV = mean corpuscular volume, which is a determination of the size of a RBC\n*Normal MCV is between 80 – 100fl, normocytic\n*Microcytic = MCV less than 80fl\n*Macrocytic = MCV greater than 100fl"
  
  utter_Whatistotalironbindingcapacity:
  - text: This is a determination of the amount of transferrin in the blood at the time of the test
      Transferrin is the protein that binds to and transports iron through to blood to the destination tissues/organs
      Transferrin is elevated in conditions where iron stores in the body are low and depressed in conditions where iron stores in the body are high
      Body regulates transferrin levels based on the demand for iron

  utter_Howdoesibuprofenleadeventuallytoirondeficiencyanemia:
  - text: Ibuprofen is a reversible cyclo-oxygenase (enzyme) inhibitor and, as a result, decreases the production of prostaglandins 
      Prostaglandins are important for mucus production and protection of the stomach lining from gastric acid
      With low levels of prostaglandins, the mucosa of the stomach is exposed to acid leading to ulcer formation and bleeding, which can eventually become heavy



  utter_Whatisthalassemia:
  - text: Thalassemia indicates that there is an abnormality with the hemoglobin chain within red blood cells (usually each RBC has two alpha chains and two beta chains)
      If there is an inherited mutation affecting one or more of these chains, thalassemia results and can lead to a severe anemia requiring chronic blood transfusions 
      Mild forms of thalassemia can be asymptomatic and are known as alpha thalassemia minor and beta thalassemia minor
      Severe forms of thalassemia are known as thalassemia major
      More details will be explained in later questions

  utter_Whatarethehemoglobinlevelsthatindicateaneedforabloodtransfusion:
  - text: Transfusion is necessary when the hemoglobin level drops below 7.0 g/dL in most patients
      Exception is in patients with ischemic cardiac disease, in which the transfusion threshold is 9.0 g/dL

  utter_Whatisanupperendoscopy:
  - text: An upper endoscopy is a scope that is inserted into the patient’s upper GI tract (proximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum) to look for issues with the esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum
      This is an invasive study that should be performed after lab studies are completed (only time this is done urgently is if the condition is life-threatening) 


  utter_WhydoesTylenolnotcauseGIbleeding:
  - text: Unlike NSAIDs, Tylenol inhibits cyclo-oxygenase in the central nervous system and not in the peripheral tissues/blood vessels 
      As a result, Tylenol does not affect prostaglandin production in the GI tract, making the possibility of ulcer formation minimal 

  utter_Whatisaspherocyte:
  - text: A spherocyte is a red blood cell that has less “central pallor” than a typical RBC
        Key thing to note is that both spherocyte and normal RBCs are round
        Reason for this is that a spherocyte has mutations in membrane proteins which cause it to have less overall surface area
        This creates an imbalance between the amount of hemoglobin within the cell and the surrounding membrane (since the hemoglobin is a red color when attached to oxygen, this creates a darker appearance to the cell)

  utter_WhatisadirectCoombstest:
  - text: This process begins with taking a blood sample from a patient with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and exposing this blood to a “Coombs reagent” which binds to human antibodies
        Since an autoimmune hemolytic anemia has antibodies bound to RBC surfaces, the Coombs reagent will bind to this surface-bound antibodies
        This binding of the Coombs reagent will create clumping, which is seen in the blood sample and indicates a positive test (presence of autoimmune antibodies to RBCs)

  
  utter_Whatismicroangiopathichemolyticanemia:
  - text: Damage to RBCs due to increased turbulence or shear forces within the blood vessels
        This is usually due to fibrin formation and deposition within blood vessels and resultant damage to RBCs upon contact  



  utter_Whatisparoxysmalnocturnalhemoglobinuria:
  - text: Caused by a mutation that prevents formation of a GPI anchor for RBC membrane proteins
        GPI is necessary to attach proteins such as CD59 to RBC surface
        Results in a loss of CD59, which prevents complement-mediated destruction of RBCs
        Complement is a component of the body’s innate immune system that helps destroy foreign cells/proteins
        As a result, host RBCs are destroyed by their own immune systems  

    
  utter_WhatisG6PDandhowdoesitleadtoextravascularhemolysis:
  - text: Glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency involves an inherited deficiency of the aforementioned enzyme, which results in a lack of NADPH production
        This NADPH is critical for removal of reactive oxygen radicals, which are damaging to RBC hemoglobin 
        Deficiency results in hemoglobin and RBC membrane damage leading to removal of these cells by the spleen 


  utter_Whatisareticulocytecount:
  - text: Reticulocytes are precursor RBCs that are released by the bone marrow, especially in situations of RBC deficiency 
            Normal reticulocyte count is between 0.5% - 2.5% 
            However, more important is determine if the reticulocyte count shows an appropriate response to the decreased Hb level
            If Hb is low, then expected reticulocyte count should be greater than 2.5% if bone marrow is functioning normally 

  utter_Whatisbluelightphototherapy:
  - text: This is a type of light therapy that involves shining fluorescent light onto bare skin
        Certain wavelengths of light can penetrate the skin and convert the bilirubin into a water-soluble form
        This helps the newborn handle the excessive load of unconjugated bilirubin and prevents neurological complications such as kernicterus (damage to the brain)


  utter_Whatistheosmoticfragilitytest:
  - text: This is the standard test for diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, in which RBCs are placed in hypotonic saline solutions (decreased saline solution concentration relative to RBC cytoplasm)
        This will cause the RBCs to swell up due to osmosis and since the RBC membrane is already altered due to surface protein mutations, the cell is more likely to rupture (diagnostic for spherocytosis)
 

  utter_Whatistheacidifiedglycerollysistest:
  - text: This test involves putting the RBCs in an acidified hypotonic glycerol solution and determining how much hemolysis occurs 
        Once again, since hereditary spherocytosis involves less membrane surface area, the membrane is less flexible and more likely to burst when swollen with fluid 


  utter_WhyisthereincreasedMCHCandnegativeCoombstestinhereditaryspherocytosis:
  - text: Increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration is found in hereditary spherocytosis because the mutation of ankyrin and spectrin membrane proteins causes the RBC membrane to be stiffer and less flexible
        As a result, there is less membrane available for distention upon exposure to hypotonic solutions and less membrane relative to the hemoglobin within the RBC
        This is why the MCHC is increased and is a cardinal feature of hereditary spherocytosis s
        Coombs test is negative in hereditary spherocytosis because the issue is a mutation in the proteins of the membrane, not an autoantibody-mediated attack on RBCs 


  utter_Whyisfolicacidsupplementationhelpfulinthetreatmentofhereditaryspherocytosis:
  - text: Folic acid is critical for the conversion of uracil to thymidine in the nuclei of developing RBCs
        Hereditary spherocytosis is associated with hemolysis and this results in an reticulocytosis; reticulocytes have nuclei and require large amounts of folate for DNA maturation and development 
        Folate stores can be used up quickly in these patients and, therefore, folate supplementation will be helpful to support the increase in reticulocyte production 

  utter_WhatisthedifferencebetweenhemoglobinFandhemoglobinA:
  - text: Hemoglobin F is fetal hemoglobin and has a higher affinity for oxygen than Hemoglobin A; HbF is found more in fetuses and neonates and has two alpha chains and two gamma chains
        HbF is replaced by HbA upon birth over the course of a few months 
        HbA is the adult form of hemoglobin and is the Hb found in the highest concentration in healthy adults; the chain configuration of HbA is two alpha chains and two beta chains  
  
  utter_Whatisthesignificanceofdarkurine:
  - text: Dark urine is an indication of unusual waste products being excreted from the body; possible causes include
        Buildup of water-soluble conjugated bilirubin in the blood (due to bile duct failure or failure to excrete bile)
        Release of hemoglobin into the urine via the kidney due to intravascular hemolysis and glomerular filtration of free Hb
        Muscle breakdown and release of myoglobin into the urine
 

  utter_Whatisacuteliverfailure:
  - text: Sudden onset and severe damage to the liver, resulting in failure of its productive functions 
        Can be due to viral hepatitis, toxins, or drugs
        Signs that indicate liver failure include prolonged coagulation times (due to liver being the site of synthesis of coagulation proteins), low albumin levels, and symptoms of encephalopathy (mental status changes, neurologic issues) 
 

  utter_Whatissepticshock:
  - text: Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is defined as (2 of 4 required)
        Tachycardia (HR > 90 bpm)
        Tachypnea (RR > 20/minute)
        Fever or hypothermia (temperature >38C or <36C)
        Leukocytosis or leukopenia (WBC > 12,000mm3 or <4000/mm3)
        Sepsis is SIRS + source of infection
        Septic shock is sepsis + hypotension that does not response to IV bolus of fluids
 

  utter_Whatisglomerulonephritis:
  - text: Glomerulonephritis is a condition involving inflammation of the glomerulus (blood filtration capillary network of the kidney) 
        This leads to a constellation of symptoms
        Elevated blood pressure
        Poor filtration of blood means that fluid is retained, leading to increased blood pressure
        RBCs and protein in the urine
        Damaged capillaries of the glomerulus lead to leakage of RBCs and protein into the urine (seen on urinalysis) 
        RBC casts 
        If RBCs are released at the level of the glomerulus, casts are formed when these RBCs pass through the terminal part of the kidney tubules (large number of RBCs within a protein tubular coating)
        Elevated levels of BUN and creatinine 
        Poor filtration of urea and creatinine due to glomerular damage leading to buildup of these waste products in the bloodstream
 


  utter_Whyishaptoglobindecreasedinhemolyticanemia:
  - text: Haptoglobin is a protein produced by the liver that binds to free hemoglobin in the circulation 
        If haptoglobin levels are low, this is an indication that there is large amount of free hemoglobin in the circulation 



  utter_Howdoglucocorticoidshelpinthetreatmentofdruginducedhemolyticanemia:
  - text: Glucocorticoids suppress the immune system and response of the body 
        The drug induced hemolytic anemia is a autoimmune reaction to the drug and this will be reduced by corticosteroids suppressing cytokine formation and immune activity 


  utter_Whatisextramedullaryhematopoeisis:
  - text: Normally RBCs are produced by the medulla of the bone marrow of long bones; however, if there is a massive hemolysis or loss of RBCs occurring, sometimes the medulla of the bone marrow cannot keep up with the demand for more RBCs
        In these situations, other organs and bones assist with taking up the load
        These can include the liver, spleen, and smaller bones such as the skull, jaw, etc. 
        This is a dangerous sign and the cause must be resolved soon because these extramedullary sites are enlarged and damaged in the process 
        Also their function are diverted away from their normal, daily functions
        Body cannot maintain this high level of hematopoiesis for long (too many resources being used up)

  utter_Whatisthesignificanceofthepatient’sfamilybeingfromtheMediterranean:
  - text: Mediterranean families have a higher likelihood of having a thalassemia due to family inheritance and higher prevalence in these regions
        However, this is a trap in this question because Mediterranean patients can also have iron deficiency anemia; test creators like to throw in tricks like these to confuse students 

  utter_Whatisthesignificanceofthemalesonthemother’ssideofthepatient’sfamilyrequiringtransfusions:
  - text : The fact that the males on the mother’s side of the family have required transfusions indicates that this condition is X-linked 
        Males have only one X chromosome so if there is a mutation on an X-chromosome, the male will automatically develop this condition; females, on the other hand, have two X-chromosomes so one mutated X-chromosome will not present or will present very mildly 
        The fact that transfusions were required indicates a severe form of the disease; however, thalassemias are inherited autosomal recessive so this was another trap to confuse students
        An autosomal recessive condition will affect males and females equally  

  utter_Whydoesthispatienthavea2/6systolicejectionmurmurintheaorticarea:
  - text : When a patient has a significant anemia, there are fewer RBCs in the circulation and this reduces the resistance to blood flow 
        Reduced resistance to blood flow leads to faster blood flow -> increased turbulence 
        This turbulence will be heard in the aortic area during systole because the left ventricle generates the most pressure upon contraction
        Additionally, when there is anemia, the tissues are deprived of oxygen and will stimulate the heart to pump faster and harder -> also exacerbates the murmur 

  utter_Howdoyoudifferentiatethalassemiafromirondeficiencyanemia:
  - text : 1. RBC count
        Thalassemia has abnormal RBCs, but usually has a normal RBC count 
        However, iron deficiency anemia has a low RBC count due to lack of iron to sustain and produce RBCs 
        2. Platelet count
        Thalassemia will have a normal platelet count because platelets are unaffected in this condition 
        However, iron deficiency anemia can have an elevated platelet count due to reactivity secondary to bone marrow hyperactivation to increase production of RBCs 
        3. Associated symptoms 
        If there is extramedullary hematopoiesis, severe symptoms, or need for multiple transfusions, this is probably a severe form of thalassemia (especially if early on in life)
        4. History
        This can be a trap, but certain indications in the history can point towards a diagnosis of thalassemia vs. iron deficiency anemia 
        Iron deficiency anemia – hemorrhage, poor nutrition, heavy menses, malabsorption, etc.
        Thalassemia – young age, family history, autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, history of multiple transfusions, evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis  
 
  utter_Whatisalphathalassemia:
  - text: There are four total genes for the alpha-globin chains
        If 1 gene is deleted, then the patient is considered a silent carrier (may have mildly decreased MCV or Hb)
        If 2 genes are deleted, this is considered thalassemia trait and is usually asymptomatic but also associated commonly with a microcytic anemia 
        If 3 genes are deleted, this is called Hb H disease and is associated with a moderate to severe microcytic anemia (significant enough to cause major symptoms)
        If 4 genes are deleted, then this is alpha-thalassemia major and can lead to hydrops fetalis (fluid buildup and swelling of the baby -> death), where the production of RBCs cannot keep up with the demand and the liver fails
        Without the liver, there is poor protein production and without adequate protein levels, fluid cannot be kept within the vessels and leaks out 
        With fluid leaking out of vessels, there is poor circulation and eventual demise

  utter_Whatisbetathalassemia:
  - text: Three types of beta-thalassemia (only two beta-globin chain genes)
        Beta-thalassemia minor
        One gene is affected resulting in either reduced or absent production of beta chains from that chromosome, resulting in mild microcytic anemia
        Second gene is functioning normally 
        Beta-thalassemia intermedia
        Both genes can have reduced beta-globin chain production
        One gene has reduced beta-globin chain production while the other has absent production 
        Moderate anemia results which can lead to extramedullary hematopoiesis and iron overload (secondary to transfusions)
        Beta-thalassemia major
        Both genes have absent or severely reduced beta-globin chain production
        Severe anemia with definite extramedullary hematopoiesis
        Patient cannot survive without transfusions and resultant iron overload is common even with precautionary measures 

  utter_Whatishereditaryhemochromatosis:
  - text: Inherited condition of iron overload in a patient due to excess absorption of iron from the GI tract (due to mutation of the homeostatic iron regulator gene)
        This gene creates a protein that usually senses the amount of iron in the body; when mutated, it cannot determine iron levels appropriately and incorrectly senses the level as too low
        Symptoms can include liver damage leading to cirrhosis, diabetes, bronze colored skin, and infertility (all of these are due to iron buildup and deposition)
        Treatment is with regular phlebotomy (removal of venous blood to lower iron levels)

  utter_Topic_Anemia:
  - text: "Anemia is a condition in which you lack enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to your body's tissues. Having anemia, also referred to as low hemoglobin, can make you feel tired and weak."

  utter_Topic_anatomy:
  - text: "anatomy, a field in the biological sciences concerned with the identification and description of the body structures of living things. Gross anatomy involves the study of major body structures by dissection and observation and in its narrowest sense is concerned only with the human body."

  utter_Topic_Symptomsofanatomy:
  - text: "A symporter is an integral membrane protein that is involved in the transport of two different molecules across the cell membrane in the same direction. The symporter works in the plasma membrane and molecules are transported across the cell membrane at the same time, and is, therefore, a type of cotransporter."
