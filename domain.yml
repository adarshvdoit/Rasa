  utter_WhatisESR:
  - text: "* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a study performed to determine presence of inflammation in the body \n* If there is inflammation present, the red blood cells sink faster than normal because inflammation causes RBCs to clump together and therefore be heavier \n* Normal range for men is 0 – 22 mm/hr and for women is 0 – 29 mm/hr"

  utter_Whatisanemiaofchronicdisease:
  - text: "*Anemia of chronic disease occurs in patients who have a chronic, inflammatory condition (includes chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancy) resulting in release of liver factors such as hepcidin, which traps iron inside cells such as macrophages \n\t*As a result, this iron cannot be utilized by RBCs to help with the transport of oxygen"

  utter_Whatexactlydovitalsignsinclude:
  - text: "*Heart rate (normal between 60 – 100 beat per minute)\n*Respiratory rate (normal between 12 – 24 breaths/minute)\n*Temperature (normal between 97.8F – 99.1F)\n*Blood pressure (normal level is less than 120/80 mm Hg)"

  utter_WhatdoesMCVmean:
  - text: "*MCV = mean corpuscular volume, which is a determination of the size of a RBC\n*Normal MCV is between 80 – 100fl, normocytic\n*Microcytic = MCV less than 80fl\n*Macrocytic = MCV greater than 100fl"
  
  utter_Whatistotalironbindingcapacity:
  - text: This is a determination of the amount of transferrin in the blood at the time of the test
      Transferrin is the protein that binds to and transports iron through to blood to the destination tissues/organs
      Transferrin is elevated in conditions where iron stores in the body are low and depressed in conditions where iron stores in the body are high
      Body regulates transferrin levels based on the demand for iron
